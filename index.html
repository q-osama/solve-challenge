                I received a job offer <br> mid-course, and the subjects I
                learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>

            <p class="history"> ’’ I was an EMT for many years before I joined
                the bootcamp. I’ve
                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
                switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                startup. ”

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
                themselves. Getting guidance from them and

                gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the
                world and present myself as a capable
                junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I
                was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and staff
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                wait long for assistance. The agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
                the next level in a way that no tutorial
                could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                interviews as an example of my developent
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                developer after receiving multiple offers.
                100% recommend! ”
